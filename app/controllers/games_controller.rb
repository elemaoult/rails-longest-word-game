# Time to implement the GamesController#score logic. Do we have all the information at hand? What do we need? Do we need to pass more information through the POST request? Have a look at hidden_field_tag.

# We want to handle three scenarios:

# The word canâ€™t be built out of the original grid
# The word is valid according to the grid, but is not a valid English word
# The word is valid according to the grid and is an English word
# (You can use this API to check if a word is valid.)

# At the bottom of the results, add a link_to to go back to the New game page.
